# Goldman-Sachs_Crack-Leaked-Password-Database
Improved password Security Policies for Goldman Sachs

# Project overview
As a governance analyst it is part of your duties to assess the level of protection offered by implemented controls and minimize the probability of a successful breach. To be successful at your job you often need to know the techniques used by hackers to circumvent implemented controls and propose uplifts to increase the overall level of security in an organization. Gaining valid credentials gives the attackers access to the organization’s IT system, thus circumventing most of perimeter controls in place.

# Project Objective
What type of hashing algorithm was used to protect passwords? What level of protection does the mechanism offer for passwords? What controls could be implemented to make cracking much harder for the hacker in the event of a password database leaking again? What can you tell about the organization’s password policy (e.g. password length, key space, etc.)? What would you change in the password policy to make breaking the passwords harder?
